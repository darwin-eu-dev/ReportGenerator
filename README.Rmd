## Overview

The ReportGenerator R package creates automatic study reports from DARWIN EUÂ® research. It includes a Shiny app where the user can select a specific type of study according to the Complete Catalogue of Standard Data Analyses (D1.3.8.2), and what tables/figures to produce out of a set menu of outputs.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ReportGenerator like so:

```{r}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("darwin-eu-dev/ReportGenerator")
```

To test the package, generate first the mock data with `generateMockData()`. It will create a "Results" folder in the working directory that contains IncidencePrevalence data in csv and zip format. 

```{r}
 generateMockData(databaseName = c("Synthea"))
```

`reportGenerator()` takes as an input zip or csv files with results from IncidencePrevalence. To launch the Shiny app just type in the console:

```{r} 
reportGenerator()
```

Alternatively, you can access to an [online version here](https://data-dev.darwin-eu.org/content/5f2cf055-690c-4a28-9567-a1986eaafe8e/).
