## Overview

`ReportGenerator` creates automatic study reports from DARWIN EUÂ® research. It is a Shiny app with an interactive menu where the user can select figures and tables from the Complete Catalogue of Standard Data Analyses.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ReportGenerator like so:

```{r}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("darwin-eu-dev/ReportGenerator")
```

`reportGenerator()` takes as an input zip or csv files with results from IncidencePrevalence. To launch the Shiny app just type in the console:

```{r} 
ReportGenerator::reportGenerator()
```

Alternatively, you can access to an [online version here](https://data-dev.darwin-eu.org/content/46c367cd-6e29-4382-9d7d-aff8caaa582a/).

Load your own results from the [IncidencePrevalence](https://darwin-eu.github.io/IncidencePrevalence/) package. ReportGenerator accepts data from the latest version of IncidencePrevalence and offers limited support for previous versions. To test the package, the user can generate some mock data with `ReportGenerator::generateMockData()`, which will create a "Results" folder with data in zip format. 

```{r}
ReportGenerator::generateMockData()
```
